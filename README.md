# littlelemon_designproject

I have worked on the design and the prototype for a table reservation feature for the mobile version of the Little Lemon restaurant website.  It includes designing information architecture, and incorporating text, animations and graphics of branding and content.

This project has:

- a file with the design system and the canvas for the project,
- a file text description of the problem I am solving, 
- a file with a user persona named Carl,
- a file with Carl's journey map,
- a file with the wireframes of the design project and
- a link to access my high-fidelity design prototype: https://www.figma.com/community/file/1232306353979456901.

All the designs were made in Figma. 

The Little Lemon design project was my final assessment in the "Principles of UX/UI design" course, offered by Meta.
