# littlelemon_designproject

I have worked on the design and the prototype for a table reservation feature for the mobile version of the Little Lemon restaurant website.  It includes designing information architecture, and incorporating text, animations and graphics of branding and content.

This project has:

- a text description of the problem I am solving, 
- a persona,
- a journey map,
- wireframes and
- my high-fidelity prototype.

All the designs were made in Figma.
